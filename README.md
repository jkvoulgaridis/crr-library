## Index

* Under the contracts/ folder:
  1) **src/** subfolder contains the .sol files that 
  implement the functionality and the migrations.
  2) **tests/** subfolder contains a minimal 
    unittest suite for checking that the basic functionality
    works as expected. 
  3) **javaWrapper/** contains an autogenerated .java file which allows to use 
  the smart contract functionality in Java or/and Scala projects.
  4) **scripts/** contains scripts to compile the .sol files and to produce
    the java wrapper. 
* Under the src/ folder there is the **contractManager.scala** file
    which is a more high level warpper of the java wrapper to ease dev process
